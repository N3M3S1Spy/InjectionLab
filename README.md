# üß™ Welcome to InjectionLab

InjectionLab is an **educational toolkit** designed to provide hands-on experience with **Windows process injection techniques**. This project is a comprehensive, structured exploration of process injection, aimed at educating security researchers, red teamers, and defenders about low-level memory manipulation and exploitation methods on Windows systems.

## üéØ **What is Process Injection?**

**Process injection** is a technique where a program (typically malicious) forces code to run in the memory space of another process. This can allow an attacker to:
- **Inject malicious payloads** into the memory of a legitimate process, making it harder for security tools to detect.
- **Manipulate processes** to alter their behavior without needing to execute any code in the attacker's own process.

Injection techniques are widely used in **malware development**, **advanced persistent threats (APTs)**, and **red team operations** to test and demonstrate vulnerabilities. However, these techniques can also be used for defensive purposes, to understand attack methods and develop strategies to detect and block them.

## üìö **Purpose of InjectionLab**

InjectionLab is designed to:
1. **Educate**: Provide an in-depth understanding of how Windows handles memory, processes, and thread management. This is crucial knowledge for anyone involved in security research, reverse engineering, or ethical hacking.
2. **Document**: Offer a **comprehensive collection of injection techniques**, each accompanied by real, documented examples written in C++. Every technique comes with detailed **explanations**, **step-by-step walkthroughs**, and **context** to help users understand both the code and its purpose.
3. **Demonstrate**: Showcase various injection techniques used in **real-world attacks** and **red team exercises**. Each technique demonstrates a different method of code injection, from simple `CreateRemoteThread` to more advanced methods like `NtCreateThreadEx`.
4. **Promote Detection Awareness**: Each technique in InjectionLab also teaches users how to spot **signs of code injection**. From memory scanning to analyzing threads and process handles, InjectionLab provides a learning path for developing detection skills to protect systems from these attacks.

## üí° **What You Will Learn**

By exploring InjectionLab, you will:
- Gain an understanding of how code injection works under the hood of Windows.
- Learn various **techniques** for injecting code into a target process.
- Discover how to use low-level Windows APIs, such as `VirtualAllocEx`, `WriteProcessMemory`, and `NtCreateThreadEx`.
- Get practical experience in **memory management**, **shellcode creation**, and **thread injection**.
- Explore how to **detect** and defend against injection attempts using different forensic methods.
- Develop a deeper knowledge of **Windows internals** and **process management**.

## üîç **Structure of the Injection Matrix**

The **Injection Matrix** is the heart of the InjectionLab project, serving as a map of injection techniques. It organizes techniques by complexity and provides a visual guide to learning them. For each technique, you will find:

1. **Code Implementation**: Real, well-documented source code showcasing the injection technique.
2. **Detailed Documentation**: Step-by-step explanations of what each line of code does, and how it contributes to the injection process.
3. **Complexity Level**: Techniques are rated from beginner to advanced, allowing users to start from simple techniques and move to more complex ones.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Techniques in the Matrix**

The techniques are grouped based on their complexity:

- **Beginner**: Basic techniques that are easy to implement and understand.
- **Intermediate**: More complex techniques that require a deeper understanding of Windows internals.
- **Advanced**: High-level techniques that involve sophisticated memory and thread manipulation.

Here are some examples of the techniques you'll explore:

1. **VirtualAllocEx + WriteProcessMemory + CreateRemoteThread**: A classic method of injecting code into another process by allocating memory and creating a remote thread.
2. **QueueUserAPC Injection**: A more advanced technique involving asynchronous procedure calls (APC) to inject code.
3. **DLL Injection**: Injecting a DLL into a target process via `LoadLibrary`.
4. **Manual Mapping**: A technique for loading a DLL manually into memory without using `LoadLibrary`.
5. **NtCreateThreadEx**: An advanced, low-level thread creation technique that bypasses some detection mechanisms.

Each technique is fully documented and explained, ensuring that you gain not only the skills to implement them but also the understanding needed to analyze and detect them.

## üõë **Ethical Use**

While the InjectionLab project is a valuable educational resource, **ethical considerations** are paramount. This project is intended **for learning purposes only**. Do not use these techniques on systems that you do not own or do not have explicit permission to test. It is your responsibility to ensure that you are using this knowledge in a legal and ethical manner.

---

## üöÄ **Getting Started**

To begin exploring the techniques, check out the **Injection Matrix** in the project repository. For each technique, you will find:

- **Source code** in `src/` folder.
- **Documentation** in `docs/` folder.

You can also refer to the **injection_matrix.md** file, which provides a high-level overview of each technique, its complexity, and its source code link.
